# Regression Analysis Projects: NeuronetiX Internship

This repository contains three regression analysis projects completed as part of my internship at NeuronetiX. These projects demonstrate the application of various regression techniques to predict different outcomes based on provided datasets.

## 1. Simple Linear Regression: Predicting Salary Based on Years of Experience

**Objective**: To develop a simple linear regression model that predicts an individual's salary based on their years of experience.

- **Dataset**: A dataset containing salaries and years of experience of several individuals.
- **Methodology**:
    - Loaded and cleaned the dataset by removing unnecessary columns.
    - Visualized the relationship between years of experience and salary using a scatter plot.
    - Implemented a simple linear regression model from scratch using SciPy.
    - Evaluated the model's performance using the correlation coefficient (R-value).

## 2. Polynomial Regression: Predicting Salary Based on Position Level

**Objective**: To create a polynomial regression model that predicts an individual's salary based on their position level.

- **Dataset**: A dataset containing the levels and corresponding salaries of various positions.
- **Methodology**:
    - Preprocessed the dataset by dropping irrelevant columns.
    - Visualized the relationship between position level and salary.
    - Built a polynomial regression model using NumPy and evaluated it using the R² score.

## 3. Multiple Regression: Predicting Income Based on Age and Experience

**Objective**: To implement a multiple linear regression model that predicts an individual's income based on their age and experience.

- **Dataset**: A dataset containing individuals' age, experience, and income.
- **Methodology**:
    - Loaded the dataset and selected relevant features (age and experience).
    - Trained a multiple linear regression model using scikit-learn's `LinearRegression`.
    - Evaluated the model's performance using the R² score.
